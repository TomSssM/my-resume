## Summary

### Why I'm in Frontend

I am not here to be telling you lies. If I liked that or were good at that I would consider a career in sales or analytics. But obviously I am here for another reason.

So I am going to be honest with you: I love programming! I am very grateful that I have discovered such a huge passion for something. Many people don't have it.

Right after school I was only good at English but I knew I needed something more in life that would be intertwined with the language as well as resonate with my interests. Making websites in plain HTML/CSS felt like that kind of thing as the best tutorials and books I could find were in English. At some point Web development became the other puzzle piece of my life. It was always a drive to be writing code and see changes take place on the screen.

### My Background

My next big step was when I joined [Rolling Scope sSchool](https://school.rollingscopes.com/). RSSchool is courses with a very intensive programm in JS/HTML/CSS + Frameworks and just about everything Web related. Since then I would code every free minute of my time. I even have an app to edit JS code on my smartphone for when I am in the subway.

In the beggining I was feeling overwhelmed being part of a huge community of thousands of developers in RSSchool. And being a nobody amogst hundreds I understood I would never be given any attention at all. I could rely only on myself for my Frontend education. Since there were so many of us the competition for the legibility to keep studying was always severe. You were often told to impelemt something like a Priority Queue but never told a word about what even a usual Queue is. I remember often sitting in front of an empty Google search input and wondering what in the world to do.

So I guess what laid down the path to you is by far not a great college or a great teacher. In fact I think if it weren't for my great love for what I do every day I would never make it because when you are learning programming the only way to do it is through commitment and hard work. No special sauce here. That's why I don't recomment going into it to somebody who doesn't enjoy it. Because it was always the great lot of pleasure that I received whenever I succeeded that enabled me to stay up way past my bedtime and get up when everything was failing, and keep coding.

### What I am today

At the end of the day I found myself learning one crucial skill, which is the ability to find and learn the information I need, do it fast and produce a solid knowledge out of it. I really like the saying that if you walk through the forest down the same path you won't get out of it if you get lost in it. So for me it has always been important to know how to get out of the forest from any point and keep learning. I don't need you to tell me how to do something. Tell me what to do instead!

For a long time my studies felt incomplete. I don't like to leave alone any framework or library or anything that I am learning until I understand every line of it. TODO Now I feel sure enough of myself to file this CV.

So as you can see becoming part of _your_ community is a very important step in my career.  Now I feel like the time has finally come to take my knowledge to the whole new level!
